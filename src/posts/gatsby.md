## What's the default styling used by Gatsby?

It's using CSS Modules,  personally though I prefer to use CSS-in-JS

There's a gotcha though. From my experience, the css would work with `gatsby develop`. But in production, sometimes it is not there. This happens most often on the first page load.

The solution

```bash
npm install --save gatsby-plugin-styled-components \
    styled-components \
    babel-plugin-styled-components
```

and make sure `gatsby-config.js` has the following

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-styled-components`,
      options: {
        // Add any options here
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

## How to test locally?

For example via a phone that's in local network. You need to use run 

```shell
gatsby develop -H 0.0.0.0
```

## Trailing slash

Gatsby has a rather weird relationship with trailing slashes and that could hurt your SEO performance.

Any pages created in `pages` folder e.g. `pages/page-2.js` is created as `public/page-2/index.html` which means some HTTP server would serve the page as `http://www.codeallnight.com/page-2/`. Notice the trailing slash! By default you cannot remove this.

How about pages created using `gatsby-node.js`'s `createPages`? It the same. For example the markdown in `posts` folder would be created as `posts/markdown-title/index.html` or `posts/markdown-title/`. 

The fun part though, if you try to access the page through the client redirection and not server render, you might notice that the url on your browser doesn't indicate that there's a redirection. For example from `http://www.codeallnight.com/posts/` to `http/www.codeallnight.com/posts/gatsby`, there is no trailing slash in the end of the url. However if you refresh the page, you'll see that the url now has a trailing slash.

Now there's another twist. If you are using `gatsby develop` and try to access `http://www.codeallnight.com/posts/gatsby` or `http://www.codeallnight.com/posts`, you will **always** be redirected to the version with trailing slashes. **However**, if you use `gatsby build` and then `gatsby serve`, after the redirection (_which add the trailing slash_) you will notice that there's **another step** of removing the trailing slashes. Well it's not actually removing the trailing slash, it's modifying the url on the client side to match the `path` supplied to `gatsby-node.js`'s `createPages`. This is the reason why we decide to use `/posts/` (_with trailing slash_) as the `path` in the search page.

All in all though, the 301 redirect is still there regardless how the page is created.
